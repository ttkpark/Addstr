# Addstr
# Simple, Adding String System with limited memory

It's my one of C Source. I've decided to open it because I want to help suffering people with restricted memory.

This features...
> 1. It never uses malloc().
> It has Memory Buffers (divided into segments equally, number of ADDSTR_BANKNUM)
> which each segment is sized ADDSTR_BUFSIZE.
> #So It can serve Adding String features with fixed memory(normally 1024 Byte) 
> 2. It serves Adding String featues.
> 3. easily convertible with char*.
> 4. adding in certain length, enev replacing feature are avaliable.
